          I'm a frontend engineer with 2 years of experience building web applications 
          that are both visually appealing and highly functional. My core focus is on 
          creating clean, responsive user interfaces using React and modern JavaScript.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          I enjoy translating designs into pixel-perfect implementations and writing 
          maintainable code that scales. I thrive in collaborative team environments 
          and value clear communication, whether working with designers, backend 
          developers, or product managers.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Currently seeking remote opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful 
          products and continue growing as a developer.
